Used Notepad++ as the editor .. could have used VSCode as well.

Why did i go to AWS for this ? I found it very difficult to install confluent_kafka locally. 
Why did i not use Databricks for this ? Databricks is more suitable for hadoop / spark operations. Kafka producer code is in python.

===============================

Create a S3 bucket for-streaming-project

Upload data folder and producer.py from C:\Vinod\SparkStreamingOct2023\3-read-from-file-and-write-as-messages-into-kafka-VSCode into this bucket

Launch an AWS Ec2 instance with public IP and access to S3

aws s3 cp s3://for-streaming-project/producer.py .

mkdir data

cd data

aws s3 cp s3://for-streaming-project/data/ . --recursive

cd ..

sudo yum -y upgrade
sudo yum -y install python3-pip

sudo pip3 install confluent_kafka

python3 producer.py
